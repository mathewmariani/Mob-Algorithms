# Mob-Algorithms ![alt text](https://github.com/Gimongi/Mob-Algorithms/blob/master/Content/mobs/slime1-3x.png "Slime Fren")

Mob-Algorithms is an Open Source library for Video Game enemy A.I

I am starting with a 2D slime, but am looking to move into other style's over time as I learn more. My main interest is fantasy games but who knows what else I will work with afterwards.

### Why am I working on this?
I have always had a pretty big interest in Video Games in general, as I grew up playing Nintendo and PC games from a very young age. Ever since I have been interested in video game programming, but have dabbled in it only a little. This side project is my way of exploring some of the ideas I have for video games. Eventually I will be adding other repositories beyond Mob-Algorithms for other ideas I have written down.

I am going to be mostly working with Finite State Machines for the logic behind the A.I. Mostly because I read an article recently on the A.I logic used in the Video Game FEAR. Despite having been released in 2005, it is considered to still have some of the best NPC A.I to date. In the article it talked about how Finite State Machines were used in part to give that impression that the enemy was making decisions in response to user actions. I found it intriguing and I hope to apply similar logic to a wide array of other common Mobs and characters you find in games.

####  All code can be used freely in video games you are working on. I don't care about getting paid for this I just want bad guys in video games to feel smarter than they do right now.
